# Machine Learning Project 
This project uses C++ language with a style of object-oriented-programming.

There are some reasons for me to create it:

1. First, I'd like to train my competence of OOP after I have got in touch with JAVA in my Android class. OOP is really a both magical and useful style of programming.

2. Second, I'd like to further my knowledge in C++ because it is a very complexd language, and I would never promote myself if I don't start a __project__ in the true sense.

3. Third, it's for the AI course of this semester. I don't want to always create a temporary program whenever there comes a new homework. So, when I finished this project, it will contain the whole contents of the lesson, including PLA, decision tree, naive Bayes, etc.
